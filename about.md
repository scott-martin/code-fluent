Code-Fluent is Scott Martin.

I am a software engineer at <a href="http://peoplematter.com">PeopleMatter</a> in Charleston, South Carolina. I love to learn and solve problems. 

Every time I run into a problem, I search the internet for a solution. 

I started this blog because I want to give back. From working in a dirty scrap metal yard in Montana trying to figure out how to go back to school, through the years of school getting help with my coursework, and still now as a software professional; I have always read others blogs to help me find answers. 

Now I hope to share some of those answers with you.
